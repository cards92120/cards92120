- 👋 Hi, I’m @cards92120
- 👀 I’m interested in ensuring that my code can be clearly read on a phone.   It reads okay on a desktop.
- 🌱 I’m clearly just currently learning!  I have been working with HTML & CSS for about 3 weeks to create my website.
- 💞️ I’m hoping someone with a litte extra time might look at my work and suggest ways to improve it.
- 📫 I can be reached by email at alliedgardencards@gmail.com
- So the reader is aware, I am trying to create a way for senior citizens to meet and play cards or games in my community and surrounding areas.
- The website is non-profit and was created to provide a way for senior citizens to connect  for mental stimulation and social interfaces.
  Any and all suggestions for website improvement are very much welcomed!
